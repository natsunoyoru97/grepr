# rgrep
A demo with much more limited ability than grep. It's also one of my rust coding practices.

Effect:
![testcase1](./testcase1.png)

## TODOs
- **Support regex to find all files that matches**
- **Reconstruct the code**, try to implement ``impl`` and Trait rather than lots of ``fn`` s
- Add these functions, and maybe some more:
    - Match multiple regexs
    - You can use use your own .conf to customize the content of the args
- Add more test cases
- Add benchmarks

## Special Thanks
- [imag1ne - grepr](https://github.com/imag1ne/grepr): 
The code make me get some idea about the trait and impl things, and it is with clear structure :)
